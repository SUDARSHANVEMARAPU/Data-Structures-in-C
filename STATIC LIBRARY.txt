ar.exe - to create, modify, and extract from archives

ar -rcs is the most likely command you would use when using a Makefile to compile a library.
r means that if the library already exists, replace the old files within the library with your new files.
c means create the library if it did not exist.
s can be seen to mean 'sort' (create a sorted index of) the library, 
so that it will be indexed and faster to access the functions in the library. Therefore, rcs can be seen to mean replace, create, sort.

FORMAT: ar [OPTIONS] archive_name member_files

ar c   _library_name_.a  --> is to create an archive or library 
ar rc  _library_name_.a _file_members_ (can be of any type)--> if not exists create a library, add _file_members_ to it
ar rcs _library_name_.a _file_members_ (can be of any type)--> if not exists create a library, add _file_members_ to it in a sorted order
ar rcs _library_name_.a _file_members_ (can be of any type)--> if not exists create a library, add _file_members_ to it in a sorted order

we can also do this
ar rv/r  _library_name_.a _file_members_ (can be of any type)--> if not exists create a library, add _file_members_ to it
// v is a modifier prints creating _library_name_.a

to delete _library_name_.a, then " del _library_name_.a " 

ar t _library_name_.a --> prints the _file_members_ of library
ar tv _library_name_.a --> prints the _file_members_ of library with offsets

ar p _library_name_.a --> prints the content in _file_members_
ar pv _library_name_.a --> prints the content in _file_members_ with <_file_member_> heading

ar dv _library_name_.a _file_member_ --> deletes the filemember and prints a conformations
ar d _library_name_.a _file_member_ --> deletes the filemember

ar xv _library_name_.a _file_member_ --> extracts the filemember
ar xv _library_name_.a --> extracts all filemembers of library
//using v, prints files which are extracted
ar x _library_name_.a _file_member_ --> extracts the filemember
ar xv _library_name_.a --> extracts all filemembers of library
