# Data-Structures-in-C
My respository

This repository only contain the code of Data Structures in C. Without an Object Oriented Programming Language,  just using Structures and function pointers in C, I am simulating 
the OOP in C, and preparing .dll and .a file for all data structures.

I don't know whether this is efficient way or not, I accept any kind of comments on my code.
it is open for development, any one can fork it, and develop it.

Now I just wrtten 
2 drafts for linked list and array list.
source codes are in arraylist.c, singlelinkedlist.c(because it is a single linked list)
.dll and .a are libraries and archives of above source codes. Also respective header files are provided.
